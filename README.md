# EECS 482 Discussion Resources #

A dumping ground for my EECS482 discussion/office hour tips.

You can download non-text files by right clicking "raw" and using the normal save mechanism on your browser (or just clone the repo).

## Scripts ##

Some useful scripts. Add them to your path (on CAEN, you can make a ~/bin folder and add that folder to your path in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)  

Use

    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
    
in your RC to add the folder to your path  

I better not see any output of "git-rank-contributers" in the project feedback though...  

git-wtf can be useful for telling what's going on with your remote repo.  
git-up is a decent replacement for "git pull". It'll pull from remote and then show the log of all the commits you didn't have yet. Might be worth aliasing using your ~/.gitconfig

## GitCmds.txt ##

I use the commands in this file to generate stats that I hope to mention in discussion section. It might be worth looking at if you want to learn some command-line-foo (or gouge your eyes out if you know really command-line-foo. I chain grep like no tomorrow...)

If you want any more interesting stats, ask me about it and I'll see if I can add them!
