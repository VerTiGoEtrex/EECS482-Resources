# EECS 482 Discussion Resources #

A dumping ground for my EECS482 discussion/office hour tips.

You can download non-text files by right clicking "raw" and using the normal save mechanism on your browser (or just clone the repo).

## GitCmds.txt ##

I use the commands in this file to generate stats that I hope to mention in discussion section. It might be worth looking at if you want to learn some command-line-foo (or cringe at if you know real command-line-foo. I chain grep like no tomorrow...)

If you want any more interesting stats, ask me about it and I'll see if I can add them!
